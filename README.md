# TomatoDiseaseDetectionUsingDeepLearning
The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant. This study develops tomato disease detection methods based on deep convolutional neural networks and object detection models.Transfer Learning is a reuse of Pre-Trained model named Xception, which is used to identify the types of tomato diseases and to detect and segment the locations and shapes of the infected areas. Data are collected from the Internet and the dataset is divided into a training set and validation set. The experimental results show that the proposed models can accurately and quickly identify the nine tomato disease types and segment the locations and shapes of the infected areas.

# The main tomato disease are classified as :
1.Bacterial_spot
2.Early_blight
3.Late_blight
4.Leaf_Mold
5.Septoria_leaf_spot
6.Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite
7.Target_Spot
8.Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus
9.Tomato_mosaic_virus

# Project Definition:
Tomato crop disease detection using deep learning. The name itself clears the definition
of our project. Nowadays, due to high usage of pesticides and other chemicals, the disease in plants
is exponentially increasing. So our software solves this major problem. User has to just capture
the pic of the plant and post in the application and the rest of our app will take care. Our system
will provide cure to the disease and other necessary information on the spot.

# Conclusion
We have completed our project using python as language. We were able to determine the
positivity and negativity of each tweet. We faced a major problem in finding a disease of an image
with low resolution. We achieved 93% accuracy and 91% validation accuracy while training our
models. We have proposed an easy web application which takes an image from the user and
predicts the disease of the tomato plant with fair speed and high precision. This system can be
accessed from anywhere and any device.
