# TomatoDiseaseDetectionUsingDeepLearning
The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant. This study develops tomato disease detection methods based on deep convolutional neural networks and object detection models.Transfer Learning is a reuse of Pre-Trained model named Xception, which is used to identify the types of tomato diseases and to detect and segment the locations and shapes of the infected areas. Data are collected from the Internet and the dataset is divided into a training set and validation set. The experimental results show that the proposed models can accurately and quickly identify the nine tomato disease types and segment the locations and shapes of the infected areas.
